# Blockchain Capstone Project: Adding a Layer of Trust and Transparency Upon Existing Voting Systems using Blockchain Technologies

## Abstract

This capstone project explores how blockchain technology can enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of existing voting systems. Traditional voting systems often face challenges related to security, transparency, and accuracy of results. By leveraging the features of blockchain, such as immutability, decentralization, and transparency, this project aims to address these issues. The study highlights the advantages of using blockchain in voting systems, including increased immutability, transparency, and secure voter identification.

## Insights

In this project, we introduce the 'Voter Trust Token' (VTT), a token built on the Althash blockchain, empowering voters to participate in elections with confidence. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that every vote is securely recorded, eliminating concerns of manipulation and bolstering trust in the election process. The project proposes a total supply of 7.4 billion tokens, symbolizing the entire global population, emphasizing the inclusivity and broad applicability of the solution.

## Problem Statement

The lack of confidentiality and trust in existing centralized electoral processes has led to numerous challenges, including electoral fraud, voter suppression, and vote buying. This project aims to develop a decentralized voting system using the Voters' Trust Token (VTT) to mitigate these issues and enhance the integrity of democratic decision-making.

## Solution

The implementation of a blockchain-based decentralized voting system using VTT addresses the lack of confidentiality and trust in the electoral process while mitigating various electoral malpractices. The decentralized nature of VTT ensures transparency, prevents manipulation, and discourages unauthorized activities during the voting process.

## Project Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives

**Vision:** To establish a secure, transparent, and inclusive electoral process that fosters trust, confidentiality, and equal participation through the implementation of a blockchain-based decentralized voting system using the Voters' Trust Token (VTT).

**Mission:** Our mission is to leverage blockchain technology to revolutionize the electoral process, ensuring the integrity and fairness of elections while promoting democratic principles and eliminating electoral malpractices.

**Goals:**
- Develop a robust and scalable decentralized voting system that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology.
- Foster trust, transparency, and confidentiality in the electoral process, addressing the existing issues in centralized voting systems.
- Empower voters by providing a secure and accessible platform to exercise their voting rights without fear of malpractices or suppression.
- Mitigate electoral fraud, violence, vote buying, and other malpractices, ensuring fair and credible elections.

## Token Information

**Token Name:** Voters Trust Token (VTT)
**Token Ticker:** VTT
**Token Maximum Supply:** 7.4 billion tokens
**Token Slogan:** "Empowering Democracy with Blockchain Trust."

## Launch Date

The proposed launch date for the VTT token is October 1st, 2023. Launching on this day aligns with the significance of Democracy & elections in Nigeria, providing a target for development and marketing timelines.
